					Ted Cruz: Specifications
					An Hispanic senator from Texas who became the Left's new boogeyman in late 2013, since blaming Bush for current problems has since run its course.
					"I bet Oblamer will have Jay Carney say that Ted Cruz is the one who put up the Barrycades everywhere, LOL! Maybe instead, Democrats should concentrate on fixing that insanely expensive debacle of a website, healthcare.gov."
